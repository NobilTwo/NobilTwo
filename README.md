# Instructions and Rules

## GitHubFlow: 

>&nbsp;
>```
>Main -------------------------------------------
>Developement -----------------------------------
>Feature(optional) ------------------------------
>```
>&nbsp;

- The `main` is the final product, the safe update.

- `Developement` is where we will work most of the time. Where it involves the constant production of code. Represents the current state of the project.

- `Features` to include new features without interfering with __Developement__'s main work. It's where we'll work on a specific feature or on an isolated task. Upon completion we will merge into __Developement__. <br>
_**NOTE**_: we will use type benno/engineLights3d or type gabriel/engineFisicsGelly
